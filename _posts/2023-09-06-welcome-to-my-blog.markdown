Welcome, here you will find in the future blog entries about my development projects, techniques and method I learnt to use and might find interesting for others. 

Stay tuned as I am collecting currently some old stuff:

- Trying to bring the [webpage of my PhD thesis](https://chof747.github.io/surfcomp/) in chemical informatics live again (old but should not be forgotten)
- Get documentation for some of my more useful projects:
  - [Wiener Linien Home Assistant Extension](https://github.com/chof747/wienerlinien)
  - [Octoprint Autoprint](https://github.com/chof747/octoprint-autoprint)

And also expect two of my current electronics projects to show up here shortly:

  - [Smartmeter IR Reader](https://github.com/chof747/smartmeter-ir-reader) -- a fork of the concept and design published by [Volksz√§hler](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/hardware/controllers/ir-schreib-lesekopf)
  - A device that can tell you when the next tram is coming
