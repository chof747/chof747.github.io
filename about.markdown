My name is Christian, I am living in Vienna, Austria and I am into writing software, working with computers since school.
Interested in many things I studied chemistry and also here found myself soon enough in the field of chemical informatics. Consequently (:smirk:) I then started a career that brought me to systems integration, software development and project management in the financial services industry. 

Quite a long way, and in terms of computer work my main use of it changed from coding/compiling to working with Excel and PowerPoint to using mainly Teams to communicate with others. Therefore, not to loose the skills I gained and also not to miss the joy and energy that working with code or circuits provides to me, I still use some of my spare time to tinker around, try out new platforms and languages, design and build some electronics (yes and sometimes letting the magic smoke out). And the outcome of all of this you can find on my [github account](https://github.com/chof747).

Hope you find something useful here, but if you miss anything, send me a comment or write me a message.
